This project multiples matrices

Most of the code is sourced from

You can either use the matrix_multiplication.cpp file and 
hard code changes
OR
build matrix_multiplication_console_input.cpp and input
the numbers in the console. When putting it in the console, 
put in the dimensions of the height and width, then input the
values (integer only) of the matrix line/row by line/row with either 
whitespace or line break to the console
