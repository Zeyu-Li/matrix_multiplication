# C++ Boilerplate
About 
-------
This project folder is a boilerplate for c++ projects. 
It is free to use (MIT Licence)

The main cpp file in src is just the main function with cstdio lib

    using namespace std;
    int main()
    {
    
        return 0;
    }

## Project files
* includes - placeholder txt file

Nothing more, nothing less
